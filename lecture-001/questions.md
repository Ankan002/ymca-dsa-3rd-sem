### Questions

1. Write a program to implement Linear Search and also analyze its Time & Space Complexity.

2. Write a program to implement Binary Search and also analyze its Time & Space Complexity.

3. Given a sorted array of n elements, possibly with duplicates, find the number of occurrences of the target element.

4. Write a program to find peak of an array which increases strictly and then decreases strictly. Also analyze its Time & Space Complexity.

5. There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values). After the possible rotation of the given array, find an integer target, return the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums.

6. Given an array arr of positive integers sorted in a strictly increasing order, and an integer k. Write a function to return the kth positive integer that is missing from this array.
